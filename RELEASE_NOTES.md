## Current Functionality
including any known bugs, assumptions, or limitations

Currently, our project has the ability to lock and unlock a door through an in-app button press, NFC tap, iOS shortcuts, and Siri. It is also possible to create an account and log in with credentials being stored securily. Our project also allows a user to register ownership of doors as well as share access and ownership of those doors. Shared access can also be assigned to certain timeframes. Shared access allows other users to lock and unlock doors which do not belong to them.
