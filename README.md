# CompSci 390 Project

## Executive Summary
Introducing Sentinel: Our goal is to allow students to control their door from anywhere, enabling them to unlock their door and grant access to whoever they choose with the use of a smart lock. Whether you forget your keys or a friend needs something from your room when you arenâ€™t home, Sentinel will ensure your door can be opened whenever you need. Our hope is to create a functioning smart lock mechanism that can not only be opened with a tap of your phone using an NFC sticker, but also connects to an iOS app which allows others to unlock your door during any given timeframe, and keep track of who has had access to your door and unlocked it.
