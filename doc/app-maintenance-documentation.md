## Update or Change Key Non-Programming Components
To change database information, one would need to be granted ownership access to our Firebase Sentinel database linked here: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/sentinel-a6249/overview. Then, they would be able to change both the rules and the information stored here. 
The web infrastructure is expandable and allows for, say, switching to another domain instead of tunnel.kundu.io in the future. If these things were changed, which is unlikely, because they are inextricably linked in the source code, it would be by means of an update.
